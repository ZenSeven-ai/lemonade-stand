# lemonade-stand

06/05
- made edits to HUD so lemons actually appear to increase
- next steps: make the cups of lemonade increase on button click (interaction with the cup and the signals with the HUD)
- make the coins increase when player interacts with the stand with cups of lemonade
- music for the game, and sound effects for the lemonade tree, cups, and stand, possibly walking sounds too?
- special: make it so customers come in and games ends once the customers go off screen


06/06
- made lemonade from the cups when press interact
- fixed issues where leons won't increase when player walks away
- things to still do: add sounds when picking the lemons, making lemonade
- make money when selling to the stand
- also the special.
